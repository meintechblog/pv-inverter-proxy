"""Boot-time recovery hook (SAFETY-04).

Runs as root via pv-inverter-proxy-recovery.service BEFORE the main service
on every boot. If a PENDING update marker is found WITHOUT a corresponding
post-update LAST_BOOT_SUCCESS, the previous release symlink is restored.

Critical design rules:
1. NEVER exit non-zero. If recovery cannot help, it logs CRITICAL and exits 0
   so the main service still attempts to start. A failing recovery unit
   would block boot, which is strictly worse than a no-op.
2. Only flip the symlink when we have a VALID previous_release directory.
   Bogus markers are ignored with a CRITICAL log, not acted upon.
3. The symlink flip is atomic via os.replace — if we crash mid-flip the
   old symlink is still intact.
4. Once we successfully flip, delete the PENDING marker so we don't loop
   on the next boot.
